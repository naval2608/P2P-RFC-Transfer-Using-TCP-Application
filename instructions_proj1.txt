	Enter Port to Listen:7734
	Enter software version P2P-CI/X.Y:P2P-CI/1.0
	Enter server directory full path:/home/naval-ubuntu/Project1/server/  (***it should be the full path ending with "/"***)

After this the server is ready


Then start the client by :

1. Go to the directory where client python file is located.
2. run the command in terminal : "python client_proj1.py"
3. Pass the arguments when prompted, the following arguments will be prompted,
	Enter server-name:192.168.0.112
	Enter server-port:7734
	Enter hostname:192.168.0.112 (***this is the client IP***)
	Enter Portno(b/w 1025 and 65535) to connect with server:10001  (***port to which client will connect with the server****)
	Enter Portno(b/w 1025 and 65535) to serve peers:10002	(***upload port to which client will listen for other clients****)
	Enter s/w version(format P2P-CI/X.Y):P2P-CI/1.0
	Enter client directory full path:/home/naval-ubuntu/Project1/client1/	(***it should be the full path ending with "/"***)

After this the client is ready

Now use the menu option provided in the client to interact with the server and other clients
